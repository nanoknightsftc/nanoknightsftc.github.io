        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>FIRST Tech Challenge</h3>
            <p>FTC Robotics is a program that offers a unique learning experience for students who are interested in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). FTC stands for FIRST Tech Challenge, and the program is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in designing, building and programming robots to compete in various challenges.</p>
            
            <p>FTC Robotics is more than just a robotics program. It is an opportunity for students to develop important skills that will benefit them in all areas of their lives. Through the program, students learn problem-solving skills, teamwork abilities, leadership opportunities, and much more.</p>
            
            <p>The FIRST Tech Challenge combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Teams design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format. Participants call it "the hardest fun you'll ever have!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>What Makes FTC Unique</h3>
            <p>FIRST Tech Challenge teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to play a floor game in an alliance format. Teams also must raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific judged awards. Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting World Championship.</p>
            
            <p>The program is built on FIRST Core Values including discovery, innovation, impact, inclusion, teamwork, and fun. These values guide everything we do as a team and help us grow not just as robotics competitors, but as well-rounded individuals prepared for future challenges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Gracious Professionalism and Cooperation</h3>
            <p>Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions.</p>
            
            <p>Cooperation is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Cooperation is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Cooperation involves learning from teammates and mentors, teaching others, competing hard while treating others with respect and kindness.</p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Our approach to robot design focuses on creating mechanisms that are both effective and reliable. We prioritize simplicity where possible, knowing that simpler systems are easier to maintain and troubleshoot during competitions.</p>
            
            <p>Each design decision is made with careful consideration of the game requirements, our team's capabilities, and the lessons we've learned from previous competitions. We utilize CAD software to plan our builds and ensure all components work together harmoniously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Programming Strategy</h3>
            <p>Our programming team has developed sophisticated autonomous routines that leverage computer vision and sensor feedback. We continuously refine our code through testing and iteration, ensuring consistent performance in competition.</p>
            
            <p>Driver control programs are designed with input from our operators to provide precise, responsive control. We implement failsafes and error handling to maintain stability even under challenging conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>Throughout the season, we maintain detailed documentation of our robot's performance. This allows us to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions about modifications and refinements.</p>
